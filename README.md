## üîå Backend Requirement

This is a **frontend-only** application. To make it fully functional, you must have a WebSocket server running locally that the client can connect to.

* **Connection URL:** The client is hardcoded to connect to `ws://localhost:8080`.
* **Message Protocol:** The server must handle a specific JSON-based message format.

### Client-to-Server Messages

The client sends messages with a `type` and a `payload`.

1.  **Join Room:** Sent when a user joins a chat room.
    ```json
    {
      "type": "join",
      "payload": {
        "roomId": "your-room-id",
        "userName": "your-name"
      }
    }
    ```
2.  **Send Chat Message:** Sent when a user sends a message.
    ```json
    {
      "type": "chat",
      "payload": {
        "message": "Hello world!",
        "sender": "your-name"
      }
    }
    ```

### Server-to-Client Messages

The client expects to receive messages with a `type`.

1.  **System Message:** For notifications like users joining.
    ```json
    {
      "type": "system",
      "message": "Alice has joined the room."
    }
    ```
2.  **Chat Message:** For messages sent by other users.
    ```json
    {
      "type": "chat",
      "sender": "Alice",
      "message": "Hey everyone!",
      "timestamp": "..."
    }
    ```
